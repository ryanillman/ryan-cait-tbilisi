Things are going well here. Very different and very strange. Definitely not like home! BUT, it's an adventure! The food is great, we haven't had anything that we didn't like. We aren't always sure exactly what we are eating though. The coffee situation leaves a lot to be desired, like a cup of coffee for example 🤦‍♀️ We can't find it anywhere. 

We met with the founder of Royale the other day. She was very nice and gave us a bag of things that she said most intended parents (IP) forget and some fun stuff. We met with the doctor yesterday and got things started. We go back next Monday.

We hope everyone is doing well and know that we miss you all very much!


The first picture is of our miniature Christmas tree. It's the best we could do but it makes me feel better.

The second picture is of the stairway in the building we are staying at.

The rest of the pictures are just of neat sights we have seen.
