Hi everyone!!

We made it to Georgia with no problems and not a lot of sleep. We are 12 hours ahead and still trying to get used to it and get our internal clocks adjusted.

We are staying at Hotel David Sultan, 16 Paolo Iashvili St, T'bilisi. The hotel phone is +995 032 293 5006

The hotel is neat, old and quaint. They serve breakfast every day. This morning, after only a couple hours of sleep, we went down and a nice breakfast. Absolutely no idea what some of the food was but it was good!

We are meeting with the founder/owner of Royale momentarily to go over logistics, which we were supposed to do a week ago. 

We will do our best to keep you all posted on how it's going ðŸ™‚
