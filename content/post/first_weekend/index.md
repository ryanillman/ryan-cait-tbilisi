Saturday we took the Funicular up to Mtatsminda Park, an ammusement park and gathering place not entirely dissimilar from Seattle Center before they took the rides out.

The park is at the top of a hill (I think they call it a mountain) and offers spectacular views of the city.

We found a booth that had an espresso machine, and had our first non-instant coffee since getting here. It turns out Irish Coffee was on the menu.

The two most prominant buildings are a restaurant and bar that also happen to be the top of the Funicular and the main TV broadcast antenna for Georgia. We can actually see both from our hotel room. We wandered around for a while, most of the rides were shut down for the winter/maintenance, but it looks like there will be a big New Years festival up there. We might have to go back and check it out. 

We found the perfect ride for Killian, Jurassic Park:

Before heading back down the hill we ate in the restaurant. Cait had mould wine and Ryan had Turkish coffee

On the walk home, Cait spotted a kitty:

Here's the view from our hotel room. The tree is rather annoying.
